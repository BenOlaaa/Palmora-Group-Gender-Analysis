Palmora Gender Analysis: This investigation is carried out to see if the publication is accurate and to make recommendations. The dataset was cleansed, and the gender-neutral individuals were renamed Neuter. For the analysis, I also used Power BI.

The following are some of my data analysis:

Gender Representation
The organization's total gender breakdown shows that 49.15 percent of males and 46.62 percent of women work there. Gender Neutral accounts for 4.23 percent of the population.

Wage Distribution: Across the entire region, the average salary for men and women in all departments of the organization is not the same. Men typically earn more than women. Even in departments where there are more women than men, men earn more. The departments to concentrate on here are Legal, Product Management, Support, and Accounting.
